## Summary

During the period December 2017 - March 2018, Kaggle held a competition called [Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/overview). The goal was to identify and classify online toxic comments at Wikipedia. A full description of this competition can be found on the Kaggle site.

For processing the data, text vectorization or text embedding was used in two alternate solutions. For modeling the data, an ensemble (including gradient boosting, random forest, and logistic regresstion) or deep learning (LSTM) was used in the solutions.
